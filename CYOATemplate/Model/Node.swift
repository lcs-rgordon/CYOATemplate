The crew of the research vessel *Maray* screws down the hatch clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of the ocean. The *Seeker* crew begins lowering by a strong, but thin, cable. Within minutes, you are so deep in the ocean that little light filters down to you. The silence is eerie as the *Seeker* slips deeper and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole and see strange white fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to look at youâ€“an intruder from another world.",
